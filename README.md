# GoodWe + Amber + AlphaESS export-cost guard

This project controls a **GoodWe GW5000-DNS-30** (Modbus-TCP) using:
- **Amber** prices (import + feed-in) to decide whether exporting is financially bad
- **AlphaESS OpenAPI** telemetry (battery SOC / pGrid / load / charge) to keep export near zero *when export would cost money*

It is designed to **avoid paying to export**, while allowing normal production when feed-in is positive.

---

## Quick start

### 1) Install requirements
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2) Create `.env`

Copy `env.example` to `.env` and fill in at least:

* `AMBER_API_KEY`
* `AMBER_SITE_ID`
* `GOODWE_HOST`
* `GOODWE_UNIT`
* `ALPHAESS_APP_ID`
* `ALPHAESS_APP_SECRET`
* `ALPHAESS_SYS_SN` (or use the numeric index shortcut)

```bash
cp env.example .env
nano .env
```

### 3) Run

`start.sh` exports variables from `.env` and runs `control.py`:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Or run directly (make sure env vars are exported):

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
python3 control.py
```

### 4) Emergency 'turn limiter off'

`turnoff.py` writes register 256 back to 100%.

```bash
python3 turnoff.py --host 192.168.1.10 --port 502 --unit 247 --value 100
```

## What the controller does (logic)

Every loop, it:

1. **Fetches Amber current prices**

* `import` = cents/kWh you pay
* `feedIn` = cents/kWh you receive (can be negative)

2. Computes:

* `export_costs = (feedIn < EXPORT_COST_THRESHOLD_C)`

  * Default threshold is `0.0c`
  * Meaning: if feed-in becomes negative, exporting costs money.

* If you want to avoid exporting unless feed-in is above some minimum (even if it’s still positive), set `EXPORT_COST_THRESHOLD_C` to that value (e.g. `1.0`).

3. **Fail-safe behaviour**

* If Amber is stale/unavailable beyond `AMBER_MAX_STALE_SEC`, the script assumes exporting **may** be costly.
* If exporting is assumed costly AND AlphaESS data is stale/unavailable, it sets GoodWe output to **0%** (stop generation) to avoid accidental export.

---

## Control behaviour when export would cost money

When `export_costs=True` (i.e. `feedIn < EXPORT_COST_THRESHOLD_C`), the controller aims to keep **grid export near zero** by limiting the GW5000 to roughly:

* **target PV** ≈ `pload + battery_charge` (then trimmed using `pGrid` feedback)
* a small **import bias** is applied to avoid tiny accidental exports *only when the battery is full* (`ALPHAESS_GRID_IMPORT_BIAS_W`).
* when the battery is not full, bias defaults to 0 (`ALPHAESS_GRID_IMPORT_BIAS_W_WHEN_NOT_FULL`) to avoid encouraging battery discharge.

This naturally does what you want near full battery: as the battery charge tapers down, `battery_charge` drops, so the target drops and the GW5000 backs off automatically — no extra “near‑full SOC” threshold is required.

Optional “auto charge headroom” (helps charging start / continue when the battery isn’t full):

* If `SOC < ALPHAESS_AUTO_CHARGE_BELOW_SOC_PCT` and `ALPHAESS_AUTO_CHARGE_W > 0`, the controller will assume the battery can absorb up to `ALPHAESS_AUTO_CHARGE_W` (clamped by `ALPHAESS_AUTO_CHARGE_MAX_W`) **only when the battery is idle/discharging** and will leave PV headroom accordingly.
  * This is intentionally a **kick‑start** (avoids a “never starts charging” equilibrium).
  * It will **not** keep forcing extra headroom once the battery is already charging — important near full SOC where the battery naturally tapers charge power.
* Set `ALPHAESS_AUTO_CHARGE_W=0` to disable this behaviour.


### Charge-seek (recommended)

When **export would cost money**, using `measured_charge` as the desired charge rate can "lock" the PV limit at whatever the battery happens to be charging at (e.g. 55 W), even though the battery could accept more if you briefly provide additional surplus.

The **charge-seek** loop avoids that by maintaining a slowly-adapting **offset** above the measured charge
(so we don’t get stuck at an under-reported `measured_charge` value):

* If the battery is charging and grid export is **at/below** `ALPHAESS_EXPORT_ALLOW_W`, it gently increases the offset.
* If grid export rises **above** `ALPHAESS_EXPORT_ALLOW_W`, it backs the offset down quickly.
* When the battery is full, it resets the offset to 0.

Tune with:

* `ALPHAESS_EXPORT_ALLOW_W` (default 50) — set to `0` for *strict* zero-export behaviour.
* `ALPHAESS_CHARGE_SEEK_INTERVAL_SEC` (default 10)
* `ALPHAESS_CHARGE_SEEK_STEP_W` (default 100)
* `ALPHAESS_CHARGE_SEEK_MAX_W` (default = `ALPHAESS_AUTO_CHARGE_MAX_W`) — absolute cap on desired charge
* `ALPHAESS_CHARGE_SEEK_MAX_OFFSET_W` (default 1500) — cap on how far above measured charge we will “seek”
* `ALPHAESS_CHARGE_SEEK_MAX_STEP_W` (default 2000)
* `ALPHAESS_CHARGE_SEEK_REDUCE_GAIN` (default 1.0)

If you see export spikes, reduce `ALPHAESS_CHARGE_SEEK_STEP_W` and/or increase `ALPHAESS_CHARGE_SEEK_INTERVAL_SEC`.


## When export does NOT cost money

If `export_costs=False`, the controller requests **100% output**.

Whether it also disables GoodWe’s export limit function depends on:

* `GOODWE_ALWAYS_ENABLED=1` (default): keep limiting enabled but set % to 100
* `GOODWE_ALWAYS_ENABLED=0`: disable export limiting when export is allowed

---

## Sign conventions (important)

AlphaESS values can have different sign conventions depending on firmware/endpoint.

This script normalises internally to:

* `pBat`: **+ charging**, **- discharging**
* `pGrid`: **+ import**, **- export**

If your readings look backwards in logs, flip:

* `ALPHAESS_PBAT_POSITIVE_IS_CHARGE`
* `ALPHAESS_PGRID_POSITIVE_IS_IMPORT`

There is also an optional safety net:

* `ALPHAESS_PGRID_AUTODETECT` (default 1) — tries to infer the pGrid sign from a simple power balance and
  correct it for control decisions. This helps if the sign is mis-set, but it’s still best to configure
  `ALPHAESS_PGRID_POSITIVE_IS_IMPORT` correctly so logs are intuitive.

Example:
If the log shows `pgrid=+200W` while you are clearly exporting, set:
`ALPHAESS_PGRID_POSITIVE_IS_IMPORT=0`

---

## GoodWe registers and modes

Two limiter modes exist:

### `GOODWE_EXPORT_LIMIT_MODE=active_pct` (recommended)

* Writes the active power limit percentage into:

  * `GOODWE_ACTIVE_PCT_REG` (default 256)
* Also writes `GOODWE_EXPORT_SWITCH_REG` (default 291) on/off

### `GOODWE_EXPORT_LIMIT_MODE=pct`

* Writes the percentage into:

  * `GOODWE_EXPORT_PCT_REG` (default 292)
  * `GOODWE_EXPORT_PCT10_REG` (default 293) as % × 10
* Also writes `GOODWE_EXPORT_SWITCH_REG` (default 291) on/off

---

## Modbus reliability / reconnect

The Modbus client includes:

* Compatibility across pymodbus versions (`unit=` vs `slave=` vs `device_id=`)
* Auto-reconnect on common socket errors (Broken pipe, reset, timeout, etc.)

Tune with:

* `MODBUS_RECONNECT_ON_ERROR`
* `MODBUS_RECONNECT_MIN_BACKOFF_SEC`
* `MODBUS_RECONNECT_MAX_BACKOFF_SEC`

---

## Tuning / troubleshooting

### `It keeps limiting even when feedIn is positive`

* Confirm your pricing sign:

  * feedIn > 0 should mean you’re paid
  * feedIn < 0 means you pay
* `EXPORT_COST_THRESHOLD_C` should usually be `0.0`

### `pGrid looks wrong`

Flip `ALPHAESS_PGRID_POSITIVE_IS_IMPORT`.

### `Battery never shows charging/discharging correctly`

Flip `ALPHAESS_PBAT_POSITIVE_IS_CHARGE` or adjust `ALPHAESS_PBAT_IDLE_THRESHOLD_W`.

### `Too many writes / oscillation`

Increase:

* `MIN_SECONDS_BETWEEN_WRITES`
* `LIMIT_SMOOTHING`
* `MIN_PCT_STEP`

### Enable deeper logs

Set:

* `DEBUG=1`

### Log files + rotation

By default, each process writes a rotating log file into `./logs/` (e.g. `logs/control.log`) and also logs to stdout. Rotation is size-based so logs don’t grow unbounded.

Settings (all optional):

* `LOG_DIR` (default `logs`)
* `LOG_MAX_BYTES` (default 5242880 = 5MB)
* `LOG_BACKUP_COUNT` (default 5)
* `LOG_TO_STDOUT` (default 1)
* `LOG_LEVEL` (default `INFO`, or `DEBUG` when `DEBUG=1`)

## Safety note

This controller can materially affect inverter output.
Test carefully, start with conservative settings, and monitor logs when making changes.

## Pattern 2 stack (JSON export ➜ SQLite ➜ API+SSE ➜ UI)

This repository can run as four small processes:

1) **control.py** (controller) writes 1 JSON file per loop into `EVENT_EXPORT_DIR`.
2) **ingest_to_sqlite.py** watches that directory and imports events into SQLite (`INGEST_DB_PATH`).
3) **api_server.py** exposes a small HTTP API + **SSE** stream backed by SQLite.
4) **ui_server.py** serves a simple live web UI that connects to the API.

### Controlling SQLite size

There are two levers:

1) **Raw payload inclusion** (in `control.py`)

Large upstream payloads (Amber raw price/usage arrays, Alpha raw response) can explode the DB size if stored on every loop.

Use:

* `EVENT_EXPORT_AMBER_RAW_MODE=on_change` (default)
* `EVENT_EXPORT_ALPHA_RAW_MODE=on_change` (default)

2) **Retention / de-duplication** (in `ingest_to_sqlite.py`)

* Keep full events for 48h, then slim older rows: `INGEST_RETENTION_FULL_HOURS=48`
* Optionally delete very old rows: `INGEST_RETENTION_DELETE_AFTER_DAYS=30`
* Optionally reduce the number of stored rows by skipping near-identical consecutive events:

  * `INGEST_DEDUP_ENABLED=1`
  * `INGEST_DEDUP_FORCE_SEC=30` (keep a heartbeat event for the UI)
  * `INGEST_DEDUP_MODE=telemetry|decision|decision_only`
    * `telemetry` keeps power readings (more rows, more detail)
    * `decision` stores mostly decision/limits + prices + SOC (fewer rows; recommended)
    * `decision_only` stores mostly decision/limits + prices (fewest rows)
  * Tune telemetry sensitivity with `INGEST_DEDUP_WATT_STEP`, `INGEST_DEDUP_PRICE_STEP`, `INGEST_DEDUP_SOC_STEP`
  * `INGEST_STATS_EVERY_SEC=60` emits a periodic stats line (`inserted` vs `skipped`) to confirm dedupe is working

Note: SQLite files usually do **not** shrink after deletes/updates until you run `VACUUM`:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
python3 ingest_to_sqlite.py --vacuum
```

### Run without systemd (dev/test)

In one terminal:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
python3 control.py
```

In a second terminal:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
python3 ingest_to_sqlite.py
```

In a third terminal:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
python3 api_server.py
```

In a fourth terminal:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
python3 ui_server.py
```



### React UI offline (no CDN)

The main UI (`/`) is a React page, but `ui_server.py` does **not** require a build step.

By default, it tries to load React + ReactDOM from **local vendor files** first:

- `ui_static/vendor/react.production.min.js`
- `ui_static/vendor/react-dom.production.min.js`

If those files are missing, it falls back to loading them from a public CDN.

To run fully offline, copy those two files into `ui_static/vendor/` (you can download them once on any machine with internet access, then copy them to the Pi).

The Classic UI at `/classic` never uses a CDN.

If you **never** want the UI to reach out to the internet, set:

- `UI_REACT_CDN_FALLBACK=0`

With that setting, the React UI will only load from local vendor files; if they are missing you can still use `/classic`.

Then open:

- UI: `http://<pi-ip>:8000/`
  - By default the UI server **reverse-proxies** `/api/*` to the API on `127.0.0.1:8001`, so your browser stays same-origin (no CORS, and no 127.0.0.1 pitfall).
- API health (from the Pi): `http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/health`
  - To expose the API on your LAN: set `API_HOST=0.0.0.0` and (if the browser connects directly) set `UI_PROXY_API=0`, `UI_API_BASE=http://<pi-ip>:8001`, and `API_CORS_ORIGINS=http://<pi-ip>:8000`.

### Notes

- **Atomic export**: `control.py` writes `*.json.tmp` then renames to `*.json`, so the ingest process never sees partial files.
- **Idempotent import**: events have `event_id` and SQLite enforces uniqueness so re-running the ingester is safe.
- **CORS**: only required when `UI_PROXY_API=0` (browser connects directly to the API on a different origin).

---

## systemd

Example unit files are provided in `systemd/`.

Typical install (system services):

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system
sudo cp systemd/*.service systemd/*.target /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now goodwe-stack.target
```

**Important:** edit the unit files first to match:

- your project path (default assumes `/home/pi/goodwe_local_control`)
- your venv python path
- the `.env` file location

```

## Controlling log + SQLite growth

### Raw payloads in events

Each control-loop iteration writes an event JSON record. Some upstream fields can be very large:

- `sources.amber.raw_prices` / `sources.amber.raw_usage`
- `sources.alpha.raw`

To avoid storing these large payloads on every loop, configure:

- `EVENT_EXPORT_AMBER_RAW_MODE` = `always` | `on_change` | `never`
- `EVENT_EXPORT_ALPHA_RAW_MODE` = `always` | `on_change` | `never`

Recommended defaults are `on_change` for both.

### SQLite retention

`ingest_to_sqlite.py` can automatically slim and/or delete old rows:

- `INGEST_RETENTION_FULL_HOURS` (default 48): events older than this will have the large raw payload fields removed (but key telemetry + decision fields remain)
- `INGEST_RETENTION_DELETE_AFTER_DAYS` (default 30): delete very old events entirely (set 0 to disable)

Note: deleting/slimming rows reduces future growth, but the SQLite file may not shrink until you run **VACUUM**.

### VACUUM

To compact the DB file:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
python3 ingest_to_sqlite.py --vacuum
```
